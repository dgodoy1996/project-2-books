# <My Reads>

My Reads is a great app that can track all your favorite reads! Just simply enter the name, author, date of when you started reading and date of when you finished the book. You can leave a review and a short synopsis to remind yourself what the book is about! You can also add a list of books you want to read in the WTR section!
